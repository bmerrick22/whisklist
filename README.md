# Whisklist
This is my final project for my Human Computer Interaction course in the Fall of 2020

## About
The goal of this project was to develop a prototype for a project which would solve a user's need. In our case, it was creating a platform where college kids could share, upload, and find new recipes based upon their skill level. Checkout the final deliberable PDF and the video for a full demonstration.

## Project Breakdown
Our project only went as far as the prototype stage. We used Adobe XD to create the platform.
